# Word Search

## A simple dictionary webapp using the free dictionary api

### This website shows the part of speech, phonetic and meaning of the word typed in. The audio button can provide the pronounciation of the word.
#### (The audio function doesn't work as the api doesn't provide that functionality anymore)

### Functionalities I want to add: An audio search option.
